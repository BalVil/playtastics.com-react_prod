      <h3>Easy-Breezy Returns for Playtime Perfection!</h3>
      <p>
        We get it; sometimes, even the coolest toys might not be exactly what
        you expected. At playtastics, we want your playtime to be absolutely
        perfect. So, here's the scoop on our return policy:
      </p>

      <h4>30-Day Return Policy:</h4>
      <p>
        If you're not jumping for joy with your playtastics purchase, no
        worries! You have a whole 30 days from the date of delivery to return
        it. Just make sure it's in its original condition, with all the bits and
        pieces it came with.
      </p>

      <h4>How to Initiate a Return:</h4>
      <p>
        Returning a toy is as easy as pie (or should we say, as easy as eating a
        whole bag of Gushers). Simply reach out to our friendly customer support
        team at returns@playtastics.com. They'll guide you through the process
        and make sure everything goes smoothly.
      </p>

      <h4>Refunds and Store Credit:</h4>
      <p>
        Once we receive your returned toy and confirm it's in tip-top shape, you
        can choose between a refund or store credit. We'll process your request
        faster than a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos!
      </p>

      <h4>Defective or Damaged Items:</h4>
      <p>
        If you happen to receive a toy that's a little worse for wear or has a
        manufacturing boo-boo, let us know within 90 days of your purchase.
        We'll take care of it, no questions asked. Our aim is to ensure your
        playtime is nothing short of spectacular!
      </p>

      <h4>Shipping Costs:</h4>
      <p>
        While we'd love to offer teleportation, we're not quite there yet.
        You'll be responsible for the return shipping costs unless the return is
        due to a defective or damaged product. But don't worry; we'll make the
        process as painless as possible.
      </p>
